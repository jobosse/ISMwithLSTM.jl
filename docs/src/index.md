# ISMwithLSTM

Documentation for [ISMwithLSTM](https://github.com/jobosse/ISMwithLSTM.jl).

With this package we try to provide the tools it takes to reproduce the results obtained by the research by [Mitsui and Boers](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac0acb/meta) aiming for a prediction of the onset date of the Indian Summer Monsoon, using an LSTM architecture opposed to the echo state networks used in the reference paper.
